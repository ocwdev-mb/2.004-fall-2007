description: Laboratory project on the closed-loop performance of a proportional velocity
  controller, including an introduction to the 2.004 digital PID Controller, detailed
  study of the effect of controller gain on transient and steady-state behavior, and
  study of the ability of the closed-loop system to "follow" time varying commands.
